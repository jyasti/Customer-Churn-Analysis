# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 🔍 About the Project
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior using a sample telecom dataset. The goal is to understand key factors contributing to churn and build a machine learning model to predict future churn. The entire analysis was done using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
- `customer_churn_sample.csv`: A sample dataset containing 11 columns and customer-level churn information such as:
  - Gender
  - SeniorCitizen
  - Partner
  - Internet Service
  - Monthly Charges
  - Total Charges
  - Churn status, etc.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Initial Exploration**
   - Loaded data using `pandas`, explored structure and data types.
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Verified missing/null values and cleaned accordingly.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Used visualizations (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`) to understand distributions and churn trends.
4. **Label Encoding**
   - Converted categorical variables into numeric format using `LabelEncoder`.
5. **Model Building**
   - Used `RandomForestClassifier` to train a model.
6. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report.
